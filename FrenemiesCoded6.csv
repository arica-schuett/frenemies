 ""based on what has been transpiring in the levant, we -- the jund
 
 al-aqsa group -- would like to state our sharia-based position, 
 
 grounded on the beliefs with which we will meet god -- and we would like
 
 to put this before the entire ummah and its venerated ulema. our
 
 position revolves around the following issues:
 
 
 
 ""*first*: jaysh al-fath -- it was a blessing from god that we were part
 
 of the founders of jaysh al-fath.
 
 
 
 ""*second*: our recent departure from jaysh al-fath was due to certain
 
 reasons, some of which are:
 
 
 
 ""*a*. some factions in jaysh al-fath support projects that are
 
 incompatible with islamic sharia. this is clearly manifested in their
 
 signing of the recent statement of [staffan] de mistura [un special
 
 envoy to syria], whose sixth article states: 'to respect the will of the
 
 syrian people -- who alone have the authority to create the future
 
 constitution and to approve its articles -- and not to impose
 
 pre-conditions that impound their will.' this is one of many other
 
 articles in the aforementioned pact -- in addition to other issues, such
 
 as their statements of concession and their approval of turkish
 
 intervention -- that we deem incompatible with sharia.
 
 
 
 ""*b*. there is ongoing pressure on us from within jaysh al-fath -- and
 
 especially from ahrar al-sham -- to fight the state group [isil]. we
 
 have made our position clear on the state group in the fifth point of
 
 this statement.
 
 
 
 ""*third*: our return to jaysh al-fath; namely, we have no problem
 
 returning -- but after the violations have been corrected, as follows:
 
 
 
 ""*a*. jaysh al-fath must issue a sharia-based pact that should be
 
 approved by ulema and binding to all members of jaysh al-fath.
 
 
 
 ""*b*. jaysh al-fath must issue a statement to fight the americans, the
 
 russians, and their supporters who are fighting us.
 
 
 
 ""*c*. all factions of jaysh al-fath must clarify their unequivocal
 
 public positions on all anti-sharia rule projects.
 
 
 
 ""*d*. should a dispute arise among the factions of jaysh al-fath, god
 
 forbid, the issue must be referred to the ulema of the ummah for resolution.
 
 
 
 ""*fourth*: our position on unity -- we have never been an obstacle to
 
 the unity of muslims around sharia rule in the levant. anyone who
 
 accuses us of this is required to present the evidence.
 
 
 
 ""*fifth*: our sharia-based position on the state group: we believe that
 
 their caliphate is invalid. for the sake of god, we disavow their
 
 actions and their wrongful takfir [holding muslims to be infidel] and
 
 bloodshed of muslims. we do not approve of their dissension,
 
 disparagement of ulema, or bloodshed. we consider this to be extremism,
 
 wrongdoing, and aggression. we have a right to expel them out of our
 
 areas of operation -- and we will defend ourselves and the muslims
 
 against them -- because this is our unavoidable sharia-mandated duty. we
 
 call on the state group to sign a truce to halt the fighting between
 
 them and other islamic groups and to devote their efforts and weapons to
 
 the fight against the tyrant of the levant and the tyrant of iraq.

From Wikipedia: 
Initiation of Astana talks, and ceasefire (December 2016)
In mid-December 2016, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey agreed to suggest Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, as a new venue for carrying on the Syria peace talks.[59]

On 20 December 2016, the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Russia agreed, pursuant to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (Dec. 2015), to hold Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan.[60]

On 28 December 2016, Turkey and Russia agreed on a nationwide ceasefire plan for Syria to go into effect at 00:00 on 30 December 2016.[61][62] The Syrian Democratic Council—representing the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish, Arab and Syriac militias mostly led by YPG—was not invited to the talks.[63] ISIL, the al-Nusra Front, and the YPG were excluded from the ceasefire, and the following rebel groups signed up for the truce:

Sham Legion
Ahrar al-Sham
Jaysh al-Islam
Free Idlib Army
Levant Front
Jabhat Ahl al-Sham

 the new operations room going by the name of ""incite the believers"" published a statement on 14 october claiming the attack on syrian forces via its new channel on the messaging app telegram .
 
 
 the monitor syrian observatory for human rights had reported that government forces exchanged fire with rebel factions on 13 october within areas of the demilitarised zone around idlib province.
 
 
 pro-opposition news website al-durar al-shamiyah cited a ""private source"" as saying that the new alliance was made up of militant groups that rejected the ""sotchi"" buffer zone deal. it listed as its components the jihadist groups hurras al-din, which is believed to be al-qaeda's new affiliate in syria, the veteran groups ansar al-islam and ansar al-din front, and ansar al-tawhid group. this make-up was also confirmed by some jihadist supporters.
 
 
 the new alliance is notably missing a key jihadist component: hayat tahrir al-sham , which is the most dominant jihadist group in idlib and is al-qaeda's former syrian affiliate previously known as nusra front.
 
 
 hts's absence suggests ongoing rivalry and disagreement between it and hurras al-din. this is despite the fact that hts on 14 october issued a statement also appearing to reject the sochi deal, although some jihadist hard-liners said the statement was vague and indecisive.
 
 
 first 'incited the believers' statement
 
 
 the telegram channel attributed to ""incite the believers"" issued a statement on 14 october saying that its fighters used tens of missiles to shell the barracks and camps of government forces in jurin and the plains of sahl al-ghab the previous day.
 
 
 the jihadists were responding to an earlier government attack in hama province, added the statement.
 
 
 the alliance claimed two soldiers were killed in its shelling, and threatened more similar attacks to come.
 
 
 some media outlets had reported two syrian soldiers were killed in jurin after rebels shelled the area on 13 october.
 
 
 sohr had reported that jurin, which is located in northern hama, is part of the demilitarised zone.
 
 
 on 15 october, the new jihadist alliance published seven photos via its telegram channel claiming to show the missiles and rockets used in the attack.
 
 
 three of the photos prominently showed a black flag featuring the logo of hurras al-din, which suggested the group was playing a leading role within the operations room. hurras al-din was set up in february 2018 following the breakdown of relations between hts and its former patron al-qaeda. .
 
 
 ""incite the believers"" channel was set up on 14 october, a day before the buffer zone deal came into effect.
 
 
 the demilitarised zone around idlib province is aimed at preventing a government ground offensive in opposition areas in the north.
 
 
 hurras al-din had rejected the deal and opposes any reconciliation with the government in idlib or mediation by turkey.
 
 
 according to the deal, syrian opposition groups should withdraw all heavy weapons, including tanks and rocket launchers, from the demilitarised buffer zone starting 10 october.
